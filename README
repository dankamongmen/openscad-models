i'm learning 3d modeling. these are probably not very good examples.

## CaseLabs Magnum T10

Most of these parts are for my
[workstation](https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=Schwarzger%C3%A4t_III),
in a CaseLabs Magnum T10 case.

### Mobo side

Along the bottom, two cable shrouds plug into the cross-median holes,
and a tall, thin cable shroud plugs between them. These are printed
with the brightest white we can find, to maximally reflect nearby LEDs.

* [Bottom middle plug](bottommid-plug.scad)
* [Bottom front plug](bottomfront-plug.scad)

Closer to the front, we mount an EKWB Dual XTOP pump enclosure;
its back is mounted atop a fan, and its front atop a USB frontpiece
mounted into a FlexBay. These are printed in black.

* [XTOP front mount](xtopbrace.scad)

Around the front XTOP mount, we have two white pieces to hide
cables going to the Corsair iCUE Commander Core XT.

* [Front piece](xtopfront.scad)
* Back piece—not yet done

Above the motherboard, two more cross-median holes are plugged, these
with thin, angular/curvilinear channels through which wires are run.

* [Top front plug](cpuplug.scad)
* Top back piece—not yet done

Finally, each 4x3.5" disk enclosure has a wrapper:

### Back

The Quantum Kinetic FLT is attached with mounting brackets, but there is no
top on this structure. We cover the top, and add a depression in which we
place a magnet, and mount the WiFi antenna.

* [Reservoir top](reservoir-part.scad)

We replace one of the top corks with one containing a Molex passthrough.
This will be used to power the Quantum Kinetic's Vario pump.

### Front

We mount a Libre Le Potato to a Waveshare 5.5" capacitive AMOLED, and slide
the assembly into a brace, which is mounted into the top two FlexBays.

### PSU side

We need a platform for both an Arduino MEGA 2560 and an RH Electronics
Geiger counter.

Like the mobo-side enclosures, we need a wrapper on our CaseLabs 4x3.5"
disk cages.
